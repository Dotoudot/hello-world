hello world

20 May 2019

Well this is my first try after so many months/years looking at github as a giant thing for geeks. Here I am trying to make my way through this world. I don't know how long it will last but if in 10 years (yeah 10 years not 9 or 12) down the line I can still look at this and I became a better person then I'll be incredibly happy.

**Objectives**
1. Get a better understnding of prorgraming
2. Forget one and work to make the world a better place. Not like Danerys but more like me, how I want to imagine it.
3. Become a decent sax player (impro shuold not scare me anymore, F..k Eb Major scale)
4. Travel the world speak 4 languages at least and 5 ideally

Done on Ubutunu 18
